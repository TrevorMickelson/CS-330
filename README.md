## How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software depends on the size of the project. But generally speaking, I like to modularize things, separate logic into specific packages and files, and
I also prefer my functions to be small (when I can help it). In the scenario of this project, I was a bit sloppy on a lot of this, and that was largely because I was interacting
with the new OpenGL library. I think I could definitely improve my ability to write clean code in uncomfortable languages/libraries.

## How do I approach developing programs?
Well, assuming the design problem has already been solved. The actual development consists of determining the requirements, and constantly tweaking the code based
around the specific goals. This could be done with UNIT testing, or even just manual testing.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help me reach my goals because I ultimately want to be a top level software engineer. By top level, I mean I want to be one of the best at whatever
specific area in computer science I choose. Computer science is an absolute requirement for being a software engineer.
